# Academic Progress Rate Analysis for NCAA DI Athletes

## Overview

As a student-athlete, I know that balancing academics and athletics is very difficult. Some schools and teams have a harder time keeping their athletes eligible to play (by academic standards) than others. In this project, I wanted to find out what factors might influence academic progress rates, and by extension, retention rates, and whether these rates are similar among all sports at a specific school, or among similar schools (in terms of demographics). 

- **Dataset Source**: [NCAA Website](https://www.ncaa.org/sports/2016/12/14/shared-ncaa-research-data.aspx)
- **Tools Used**: R
- **Statistical Methods**: Principal Component Analysis, K-Means Clustering, Canonical Correlation Analysis

## Objectives 
1. Determine how many clusters to use and what variable(s) influence the clustering the most.
2. Analyze cluster trends in various sports for a few selected schools.
3. Perform CCA and determine which variables have the highest influence on the canonical covariates, as well as the correlation between canonical covariates.
